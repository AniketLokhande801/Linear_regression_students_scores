# Linear_regression_students_scores
Linear Regression with Python Scikit Learn , Simple Linear Regression we will predict the percentage of marks that a student is expected to score based upon the number of hours they studied.


Code Explanation:


Imported Libraries:  Libraries like numpy for numerical operations, matplotlib for plotting, and LinearRegression from sklearn for the regression model.


Provided Data:  Example data with hours studied and marks scored.


Data Splitting:  The data is split into training and testing sets using train_test_split.


Model Training:  A linear regression model is created using LinearRegression() and trained using the training data.


Prediction:  The trained model is used to predict marks based on the test set of hours studied.


Plotting Results:  Actual data points are plotted along with the regression line to visualize the relationship.
